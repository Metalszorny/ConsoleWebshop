# ConsoleWebshop
================


About:
------
The Task:
	Make a webshop order system in the Oracle database management.
		The webshop database can be divided into four main parts; users, products, manufacturers and orders tables that model
		the product ordering process.
		The user table, which contains data for registered users.
		The username and password will be used for user identification, so the same usernames and passwords can not occur.
		The products table contains information on products. The products have their identifier.
		The manufacturers table includes information on companies. Since it is assumed that two companies don't have the same names,
		so the company name is sufficient for identification.
		The orders relation, which connects users and products, contains orders of product that the users ordered.
		It has it's own identification, but it must include the identifiers of users and products.
